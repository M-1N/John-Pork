My sincere thanks to my contact, but below I have attached a copy of John's autopsy reports, which match the ones from the newspaper clipping. </p>

I'm not gonna state his position of his role because it might give too much away, but apparently there's a hidden file that might store John's autopsy file.</p>

                <h3>Thinking</h3>
                <p><b>Entry #12:</b> It's been a busy couple weeks in my personal life, but I've been thinking since my last post. While, I am still a little sceptical about extraterrestrials, aliens, and stuff of that nature, I am beginning to wonder if John's disappearance was due to an alien abduction. Additionally, the lack of media attention, especially for a case like this which I think would result in national headlines, was a result of a government cover up. Maybe I'm too invested in this... </p>

I did some basic calculations and showed some maps of the area, and its safe to say that its an impossibility for John to end up where was in that time frame.   </p>

                <h3>Discovery of John Pork 2</h3>
                <p><b>Entry #9:</b> I'm still trying to rack my brain around this. How would a missing person that's discovered over 800 miles away, literally on the same day, not be publicized more? This should be like a national headline. Additionally, what are the autopsy reports talking about, these injuries seem kinda of outlandish. It would be really good if I could get my hands on it</p>

                <h3>Discovery of John Pork</h3>
                <p><b>Entry #8:</b> After a couple days of looking into Pork's case, I discovered something huge. The discovery of John's body. Apparently, John was found in Maine, over 800 miles from Belle Isle. I'm still a little sceptical about this though, because one, it's strange to have this publicized two months after his discovery. What's even crazier is that, apparently he had been found the same day that he disappeared. How would John have traveled over 800 miles the same day he disappeared, its impossible. </p>

                <h3>Missing Person</h3>
                <p><b>Entry #6:</b> After learning about the timeframe of the photos, I kept digging into context of these photos and stumbled upon an interesting discovery of a missing person case that happened during the same exact date, around the same time on August, 1998. This missing person was identified as then 25 yr. old, John Pork, a Virginia Commonwealth Universiy student that went missing under strange circumstances. The cirucmstances around his disappearance is quite strange because of the fact that he disappeared on a popular trail on Belle Isle where a couple of people reported seeing him past them, but then to disappear all of sudden when looking back.</p>

This time from a person, a middle aged man which his identity, I will not disclose, who I stumbled upon in the library. I was researching the "orbs," which I have come to call them when this man approached me saying that he's seen these things before back in August 15, 1998. He said it was for a brief bit, but in that time he was able to take a picture. He kindly let me take a picture. </p>
